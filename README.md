# Exploring 'Quantum Peculiarities' using single photons

Please find attached the 'Report' file containing the work.

In this Project:

1) Proved the utility of spontaneous parametric down-conversion(SPDC) as a source of single photons.

2) Did nonlocality tests, probing the seemingly bizzare phenomenon of quantum entanglement.

3) Performed quantum state tomography for various two-qubit states by virtue of the density matrix formalism.
