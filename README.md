Abstract: Assuming flat $`\Lambda`$CDM cosmology, supernovae and $`H(z)`$ (expansion rate of the universe) data are analyzed to find out ‘How transparent is the cosmos?’. By considering how distances are affected in a non-transparent universe, 
and combining analysis of supernovae with analysis of cosmic expansion rate measurements, the parameter $`\epsilon`$ is constrained. This parameter encodes departures from a transparent universe. It is found that $`\epsilon \thicksim -0.02`$, 
or more coarsely, lies in the range $`-0.06 \lessapprox \epsilon \lessapprox 0.04`$ ($`3\sigma`$). These findings support a transparent universe (negligible opacity). The amount of matter (ordinary & dark) and dark energy in the current epoch 
are also determined. This is done by constraining the mass density parameter $`\Omega_m`$ using supernovae data. The following results are obtained: $`\Omega_m`$ = $`0.276_{-0.050}^{+0.061}`$ (99.73% confidence), or equivalently 
$`\Omega_{\Lambda}`$ = 0.724. These results imply the universe today is dominated by dark energy ($`72\%`$) whereas matter makes up the remaining $`28\%`$.
